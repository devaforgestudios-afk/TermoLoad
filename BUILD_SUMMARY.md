## üîß Rebuilding the Executable

If you make changes to `app.py` and want to rebuild:

### Quick Method
```batch
build_exe.bat
```

### Manual Method
```batch
pyinstaller build_exe.spec --clean
```

The new executable will be in `dist\TermoLoad.exe` (overwrites previous version).

---

## üîç Testing the Executable

Before distribution, test the executable:

1. **Basic Launch Test**
   ```batch
   dist\TermoLoad.exe
   ```
   - Application should start without errors
   - TUI should display correctly

2. **Functionality Test**
   - Add a download URL
   - Start a download
   - Test pause/resume
   - Check history tab
   - Test system tray minimization

3. **Fresh System Test**
   - Copy `TermoLoad.exe` to a USB drive
   - Test on another Windows computer (without Python installed)
   - Verify all features work

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### First Run
- Windows may show a SmartScreen warning (click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway")
- Some antivirus software may scan the file (this is normal for new executables)
- First launch may be slightly slower as Windows validates the executable

### User Data
The executable stores data in standard Windows locations:
- **Download History**: `%USERPROFILE%\.termoload_history.json`
- **Settings**: Same folder as the executable (`settings.json`)
- **Downloads**: User-configured download folder

### Size Considerations
The 85MB size is normal because it includes:
- Python runtime (~15 MB)
- All libraries and dependencies (~70 MB)
- This is standard for Python-to-exe conversions

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Windows protected your PC" warning
**Solution**: Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway". This is normal for unsigned executables.

### Antivirus blocking the file
**Solution**: Add an exception in your antivirus software or submit as false positive.

### Application crashes on startup
**Solution**: 
1. Run from command line to see error messages
2. Check that no antivirus is blocking file access
3. Try running as administrator

### Missing features
**Solution**: Some optional dependencies (yt-dlp, libtorrent) are not included. Users should install them separately if needed.

## üìù Next Steps

### For Personal Use
‚úÖ The executable is ready to use!
- Run `dist\TermoLoad.exe` to start the application

### For Distribution
Consider these additional steps:

1. **Code Signing** (optional but recommended)
   - Eliminates Windows SmartScreen warnings
   - Requires a code signing certificate (~$100-400/year)

2. **Create Installer** (optional)
   - Use NSIS, Inno Setup, or WiX to create a professional installer
   - Adds Start Menu shortcuts, desktop icons, etc.

3. **GitHub Release** (recommended)
   - Upload to GitHub Releases
   - Include version number and changelog
   - Makes updates easier

4. **Testing**
   - Test on multiple Windows versions
   - Get feedback from users
   - Fix any reported issues
