# Quick Reference - What Was Fixed

## Problem
Torrent downloads were crashing the EXE with various errors during:
- Session initialization
- Adding torrents
- Fetching metadata
- No firewall access for P2P connections

## Solution Summary

### 1. **Windows Firewall Handling** 🛡️
- Added automatic firewall permission request
- Uses `netsh advfirewall` to add rule if admin
- Shows user-friendly message to allow access
- Non-blocking - won't crash if it fails

### 2. **Robust Error Handling** 🔧
- Wrapped ALL libtorrent calls in try-catch
- Session initialization with 5 retry attempts
- Handle validation before every operation
- Graceful degradation (features fail safely)
- Cleanup in `finally` blocks

### 3. **Better User Feedback** 📊
- Progress messages: "Initializing...", "Parsing magnet...", "Fetching Metadata"
- Countdown timer for metadata: "Metadata 60s" → "59s" → etc.
- Clear error messages: "Error: Session failed", "Error: Metadata timeout"
- Logs every step for debugging

### 4. **Session Management** ⚙️
- Retry logic with delays (0.5s between attempts)
- Validates session exists before use
- Sets to `None` on failure for clean retry
- Optimized settings for stability

### 5. **Temporary File Cleanup** 🧹
- Added `finally` blocks to both functions
- Deletes temp .torrent files after use
- Prevents disk clutter from failed downloads

## Files Changed
- **app.py**: 
  - `start_torrent_session()`: +60 lines
  - `_request_firewall_permission()`: +70 lines (new)
  - `download_torrent()`: +150 lines improvements
  - `get_torrent_info()`: +80 lines improvements

## Build Output
- **Location**: `dist\TermoLoad\`
- **Size**: 25.7 MB
- **Mode**: onedir console (fast startup)

## What You Need to Do

### 1️⃣ Test the EXE
```powershell
cd dist\TermoLoad
.\TermoLoad.exe
```

### 2️⃣ Add a Torrent
- Use any magnet link or .torrent file
- **WATCH FOR FIREWALL POPUP**
- Click **"Allow access"** when Windows asks

### 3️⃣ Verify No Crashes
- Torrent should start downloading
- No more crashes during:
  - Session start ✓
  - Adding torrents ✓
  - Fetching metadata ✓
  - Active downloading ✓

### 4️⃣ Check the Log
```powershell
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\termoload.log -Tail 30
```

Look for:
- ✅ "Torrent session started successfully"
- ✅ "Please allow firewall access when prompted"
- ✅ "Torrent added successfully"
- ✅ No errors or exceptions

2. **TESTING_CHECKLIST.md** - Complete testing guide
3. **THIS FILE** - Quick reference

## Key Improvements
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Crashes on torrent add | Smooth operation with retries |
| No firewall handling | Auto-requests permission |
| Generic errors | Specific, helpful messages |
| No cleanup | Temp files deleted |
| Silent failures | Comprehensive logging |
| 1 attempt | 5 retry attempts |
| No status feedback | Real-time progress |

## Expected Behavior Now

```
User adds torrent
    ↓
Session initializes (2-3s, up to 5 retries)
    ↓
Windows Firewall popup appears
    ↓
User clicks "Allow access"
    ↓
Torrent parsing begins
    ↓
For magnets: Metadata fetching (countdown shown)
    ↓
Download starts
    ↓
Progress updates every second
    ↓
Completes successfully ✓
```

## If Problems Occur
The app will show specific errors instead of crashing:
- "Error: Session failed" → Session couldn't start after 5 tries
- "Error: Parse failed" → Invalid torrent/magnet
- "Error: Metadata timeout" → Couldn't get metadata in 60s
- "Error: Invalid torrent file" → .torrent file corrupted

All errors are logged to `%USERPROFILE%\termoload.log`

**Ready to test! 🎯**

The firewall popup is **expected and required** for torrents to work properly.
