- Progress is shown with speed and ETA; after download, status briefly shows "Processing" while merging.

Optional setup for best results:
- Install yt-dlp: `pip install yt-dlp`
- Install ffmpeg so yt-dlp can merge video+audio to mp4.

## üìÅ File Structure

```
TermoLoad/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                          # Main application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.json                   # Saved settings (auto-generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ downloads/                      # Default download folder
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ termoload.log                   # Application logs

# User data files (per-user):
~/.termoload_history.json           # Download history
~/downloads_state.json              # Active downloads state
# Windows: C:\Users\<YourUser>\
# macOS/Linux: ~/
```

## üîß Configuration File

Settings are automatically saved to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "download_folder": "E:\\TermoLoad\\downloads",
  "concurrent": 3,
  "max_speed_kb": 0,
  "shutdown_on_complete": false,
  "sound_on_complete": true,
  "sound_on_error": true
}
```

### Downloads State File

Active and past downloads are saved per-user to `~/downloads_state.json` (Windows: `C:\Users\<You>\downloads_state.json`) so progress is preserved across restarts. For backward compatibility, the app will read a legacy `downloads_state.json` from the app folder if present.

Example entry:

```json
{
  "downloads": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "Torrent",
      "name": "ubuntu-22.04.iso",
      "url": "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:...",
      "path": "E\\\\TermoLoad\\\\downloads",
      "progress": 0.42,
      "status": "Downloading",
      "downloaded_bytes": 451231744,
      "total_size": 1073741824,
      "filepath": "E\\\\TermoLoad\\\\downloads\\\\ubuntu-22.04.iso",
      "peers": 5,
      "seeds": 12,
      "speed": "2.5 MB/s",
      "eta": "5m 23s"
    }
  ]
}
```

On startup, any entries not marked Completed or Error will automatically resume if the server supports HTTP Range requests or if it's a torrent.

### Download History File

Download history is stored in `~/.termoload_history.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "file.zip",
    "type": "URL",
    "url": "https://example.com/file.zip",
    "size": 1073741824,
    "downloaded": 1073741824,
    "status": "completed",
    "timestamp": 1729350000.0,
    "date": "2024-10-19 14:30:00",
    "filepath": "E:\\Downloads\\file.zip",
    "error": null
  }
]
```

## üìù Logs

- **File Logs**: All logs are written to `termoload.log`
- **In-App Logs**: View the last 20 lines in the Logs tab
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, ERROR

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Downloads Not Starting
- Check that the URL is valid and accessible
- Ensure you have write permissions to the download folder
- Check `termoload.log` for error details
- For torrents: Ensure `libtorrent` is installed
- For videos: Ensure `yt-dlp` is installed

### Torrents Not Working
- Install libtorrent: `pip install libtorrent`
- Check if magnet link is valid
- Wait for metadata fetching (can take up to 60 seconds)
- Ensure DHT/PeX/LSD are not blocked by firewall
- Check `termoload.log` for detailed torrent errors

### Selection Jumping in Table
- This is fixed with interaction lock (3-second hold)
- UI updates pause while you click/select
- Downloads continue in background
- If still experiencing issues, check for rapid keyboard/mouse input

### UI Not Displaying Correctly
- Ensure your terminal supports Unicode and colors
- Try resizing the terminal window
- On Windows, use Windows Terminal for best results
- For help panel scrolling issues, try upgrading: `pip install --upgrade textual`

### Shutdown Not Working
- Enable "Shutdown PC when all downloads complete" in Settings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test with real shutdown at your own risk

### Merged file not mp4
- Some sources provide formats that cannot be merged to mp4; yt-dlp may pick a different container. Installing ffmpeg helps produce mp4 when available.

### Delete + Remove Not Working
- On Windows, files may be locked by antivirus or file explorer
- Close any programs accessing the files
- Check `termoload.log` for detailed error messages
- For torrents, ensure the torrent is stopped first

## üîí Safety Features

- **Stable Selection**: 3-second interaction lock prevents UI updates while selecting
- **Background Downloads**: Downloads continue even when UI is paused
- **Smart File Deletion**: 
  - Recursive directory deletion for multi-file torrents
  - Partial file cleanup (`.part`, `.crdownload`, etc.)
  - Empty folder removal
  - Torrent handle cleanup before file deletion
- **One-Time Trigger**: Shutdown only triggers once per session
- **Activity Detection**: Won't trigger on startup, only after downloads actually run and complete
- **Sound Notifications**: Optional audio feedback for completion and errors
